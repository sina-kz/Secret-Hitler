#Secret Hitler

We implemented a Persian version of the [https://www.secrethitler.com/](Secret Hitler) game for Android systems. The logic and graphics of the game are designed and implemented completely, so anyone can easily play with their family or friends. The game is not supported to be played online yet, but we might add this feature soon. Due to Copyright issues, the apk file is not provided here and it's not developed for commercial purposes. The project is accomplished as the final project of [https://github.com/sharif-dev](CE40429 (Mobile Programming) course) at Sharif University of Technology, spring 2020.

This project is available thanks to all contributors.
